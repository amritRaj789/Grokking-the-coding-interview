BIT MANIPULATION covers approx 4% of leetcode problems. BIT MANIPULATION is the very important topic the code wriiten by using bit concepts is reliable and fast in execution if we talk about competitive coding it provide us a lot of advantage. In this article we will see all about BIT MANIPULATION and some cool bit manipulation tips and tricks with proper and detailed explanation with example.

NOTE :- IN EACH HACK I HAVE DEFINED HOW A PARTICULAR TRICK IS WORKING. NO NEED TO MEMORISE ANYTHING.

There are basically 6 type of operators which we can use over bits.

BITWISE AND (&) operator : It is a binary operator. It takes two numbers as an operands. The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1. otherwise 0.
BITWISE OR (|) operator : It is a binary operator. It takes two numbers as an operands. The result of OR is 0 only if both bits are 0. otherwise 1.
BITWISE XOR (^) operator : It is a binary operator. It takes two numbers as an operands. The result of XOR is 1 only if two bits are different. otherwise 0.
BITWISE LEFT SHIFT (<<) operator : It is a binary operator. The left shift operator (<<) shifts the first operand the specified number of bits to the left. Excess bits shifted off to the left are discarded. Left shift is equivalent to multiplying the bit pattern with pow(2,k) ( if we are shifting k bits ).
1 << 1 = 2 = pow(2,1) = (00010)
1 << 2 = 4 = pow(2,2) = (00100)
1 << 3 = 8 = pow(2,3) = (01000)
1 << 4 = 16 = pow(2,4) = (10000)
…
1 << n = pow(2,n)
BITWISE RIGHT SHIFT (>>) operator : It is a binary operator. The right shift operator (>>) shifts the first operand the specified number of bits to the right. Excess bits shifted off to the right are discarded. Right shift is equivalent to dividing the bit pattern with pow(2,k) ( if we are shifting k bits ).
4 >> 1 = 4/pow(2,1) = 2
6 >> 1 = 6/pow(2,1) = 3
5 >> 1 = 5/pow(2,1) = 2
16 >> 4 = 16/pow(2,4) = 1
BITWISE NOT (~) operator : It is a unary operator. It takes one number and inverts all bits of it.

NOTE :- The left shift and right shift operators should not be used for negative numbers.

1. MULTIPLICATION BY POWER OF 2 :-

      num = num << i;    //multiplication  by pow(2,i)
Approach :-
suppose an example

5= 101(binary)
5*pow(2,1)=10 = 1010 (shifed all bits one position to left if we compare with 101)=5<<1 (left shift by 1)
5*pow(2,2)=20 = 10100 (shifted all bits two position to left if we compare with 101 )=5<<2 (left shift by 2)
2. DIVISION BY POWER OF 2 :-

      num = num >> i;  //division by pow(2,i)
Approach :-
suppose an example

8= 1000(binary)
8/pow(2,1)=4 = 0100 (shifed all bits one position to right if we compare with 1000)=8>>1 (right shift by 1)
8/pow(2,2)=2 = 0010 (shifted all bits two position to right if we compare with 1000 )=8>>2 (right shift by 2)
3. TO CHECK WHETHER NUMBER IS ODD OR EVEN :-

   	  if((num & 1) == 0)
      cout << "Even number";  
      else
      cout << "Odd number";  
Approach :-

9=(1001)
11=(1011)
99=(1100011)
From the above figures we can easily figure out that the right most bit of odd number is 1
So if we perform & with odd number we got 1. 1001 & 0001 = 0001
And if we perform & with even number we got 0 1000 & 0001 = 0000
4. TO SWAP TWO NUMBERS :-

      x = x ^ y; 
      y = x ^ y; 
      x = x ^ y; 
Approach :-
The approach of this is basically similar as we do swapping by using arithmetic operators without third variable.

5. TO CHECK ith BIT IS SET OR NOT OF A NUMBER :-

     x = num & (1 << (i-1));
     if(x) cout<<"set"<<endl;
     else cout<<"not set"<<endl;
Approach :-

suppose we want to check the second bit of 10 (1010) which is 1 (bits counting always start from right )
10 & (1<<1)
so 1<<1 corresponds to 1*pow(2,1)=2=0010(binary)
10 & 2
1010 & 0010 = 2 if we get non zero no. means ith bit is set so here we got 2 means our ith means 2nd bit is set.
6. TO FLIP ith BIT OF A NUMBER :-

     x = num ^ (1 << (i-1)); 
Approach :-

suppose we want to flip the second bit of 10 (1010) 1 to 0 (bits counting always start from right )
10 ^ (1<<1)
so 1<<1 corresponds to 1*pow(2,1)=2=0010(binary)
10 ^ 2
1010 ^ 0010 = 1000 and here in both operand our second bit is 1 and according to ^ properties when two bits are same then resultant is 0 so in this way second bit of 10 flips to 0 from 1.
7. TO TURN ON ith BIT OF A NUMBER :-

     x = num | (1 << (i-1));
Approach :-

suppose we want to turn on the first bit of 10 (1010) (bits counting always start from right )
10 | (1<<0)
so 1<<0 corresponds to 1*pow(2,0)=1=0001(binary)
10 | 1
1010 | 0001 = 1011 so here if we notice we found that (i<<(i-1)) part set a bit to 1 at the ith place and if we perform | with the num then we get 1 everytime at the ith position in the num due to the | property. because when we | any bit with 1 then we got 1.
8. TO TURN OFF ith BIT OF A NUMBER :-

     x = num & ~(1 << (i-1));
Approach :-

Same as above one try to understand by yourself
9. TO CHECK IF A NUMBER IS POWER OF 2 OR NOT :-

     x = num & (num - 1);
     if(!x) cout<<"power of 2"<<endl;
     else cout<<"not a power of 2"<<endl;
Approach :-

8=(1000) , 7=(0111)
16=(10000), 15=(01111)
32=(100000), 31=(011111)
from the above cases we can easily notice that , the number which is power of 2 (say n) has only one bit set.
and for n-1 all the bits are set except the one which is set in the n. because Subtracting 1 from a decimal number flips all the bits after the rightmost set bit(which is 1) including the rightmost set bit.
so if we perform n&(n-1)
n=8 , 1000 & 0111 we got 0 in case of power of 2 otherwise 1
10. TO CONVERT UPPERCASE TO LOWERCASE LETTER :-

     ch = ch | ' '; 
Approach :-

The difference between the ASCII value of a lower case letter and its corresponding upper case letter is 32 and 32 is the ASCII value of ‘ ’ (space).
So if we notice that for converting A (65) to a(97) so for this we have to set the fifth bit of A. after setting the fifth bit we got 65+32=97 (a).
By the help of | operator we can set the fifth bit.
11. TO CONVERT LOWERCASE LETTER TO UPPERCASE LETTER :-

     ch = ch & '_'; 
Approach :-

we have just need to off the 5th bit of lowercase letter to convert it into upper case.
NOTE:-

    //for both lower to upper and upper to lower.
     ch = ch ^ (1 << 5)
12. TO FIND MIN MAX OF TWO NUMBERS :-

     minimum = y ^ ((x ^ y) & -(x < y)); // min(x, y) 

     maximum = x ^ ((x ^ y) & -(x < y)); // max(x, y) 
Approach :-

if x < y holds, then -(x < y) will be -1 which is all ones(11111….)
so minimum = y ^ ((x ^ y) & (111111…)) = y ^ x ^ y = x.
And if x>y holds , then-(x<y) will be -(0) i.e -(zero) which is zero
so maximum = x^((x^y) & 0) = x^0 = x.
13. TO COUNT ALL SET BITS OF AN NUMBER :-

       int count = 0;
       while (num) {
           num &= (num - 1);
           count++;
       }
       return count;
   	
   	//or
   	
      cout<< __builtin_popcount(num) ; 
Approach :-

Subtracting 1 from a decimal number flips all the bits after the rightmost set bit(which is 1) including the rightmost set bit.
for example : 10 in binary is 00001010, 9 in binary is 00001001
So if we subtract a number by 1 and do bitwise & with itself (n & (n-1)), we unset the rightmost set bit. If we do n & (n-1) in a loop and count the no of times loop executes we get the set bit count.
14. TO COUNT LEADING ZEROS :-

   int count_zeros(int num)
   {
   unsigned y;
   int n = 32;
   y = num >> 16;
   if (y != 0) {
       n = n - 16;
       num = y;
   }
   y = num >> 8;
   if (y != 0) {
       n = n - 8;
       num = y;
   }
   y = num >> 4;
   if (y != 0) {
       n = n - 4;
       num = y;
   }
   y = num >> 2;
   if (y != 0) {
       n = n - 2;
       num = y;
   }
   y = num>> 1;
   if (y != 0)
       return n - 2;
   return n - num;
  }
   
   // or
   
   builtin_clz (x)
Approach :-

The approach of this one is very simple.
we have to simply divide the number if our number is suppose that >= 16 so it is confirmed that the number will require more than 4 bits because by using 4 bits we can create a number in the range 0 to 15.
so each time we are dividing the number ith power of 2 (num>>i) if we got quotient(y) !=0 means digits will atleast required i bits so we are substracting the i bits from our 32 bits sets.
update num, num=y and repeat.
EXAMPLE :- num=16, 16>>4 we got y=1, ans=32-4=28.....then our num will be updated to num=y=1; num=1 ,1>>2 we got y==0, for 1>>1 we got 0 again so return ans-num=28-1 return 27
15. TO COUNT TRAILING ZEROS :-

   int count = 0;
   while ((x & 1) == 0)
  {
       x = x >> 1;
       count++;
  }
  return count;
   
   // or
   
   builtin_ctz (x)
Approach :-

just traversing bits from LSB (Least Significant Bit) and increment count while bit is 0.
