Prerequisite: 
We are given a set of elements such that we can divide them into two parts.
To solve the problem, we are interested in knowing the smallest element in one
part and the biggest element in the other part.

Problem 1

class MedianOfAStream {
  insert_num(num) {
   // TODO: Write your code here
   return -1;
  }

  find_median(self) {
    // TODO: Write your code here
    return 0.0
  }
};
